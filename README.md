# MeMaS: a Long Term Memory Store for AI Chatbots and Agents
**MeMaS**, abbreviated from Memory Management Service, is a Long Term Memory Store designed for AI Chatbots and Agents. We offer a simple memory abstraction (`recall` and `memorize`), as well as tools for admins to manage memory.

## Why MeMaS?
- A dedicated solution for chatbot/agent memory. 
    - We save you the time and effort to implement your own memory.
- Store knowledge as well as chat memory. 
    - Use for Retrieval Augmented Generation and can reduce hallucination.
    - Reduce need of fine tuning/retraining.
- Manage what the chatbot knows through Corpuses and Access Control
    - Improved visibility and debuggability, parts of LLMs are no longer black boxes
    - Fine grain and real time control over even individual chatbots
